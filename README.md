# Notes:
Given that the time for the task was limited, I tried to complete the task so that it met all the requirements

* the design is implemented based on the provided UX
* tests created for redux part of the project and CartItem component
* not declared option added - cart in the root directory shows the number of products added
* all necessary mechanics are observed (routing, basket display, and so on)
* Important (!): On the product page, the counter indicates the number of products that will be added to the basket

## Extra:
* added Travis CI to run tests and check the syntax
* deploy on netlify was added (the page is available at the link specified in this repository)
* "husky" added for pre-commit hooks for checking syntax and validity of tests

### PS: I will be grateful for the review. If necessary, I can make them.
